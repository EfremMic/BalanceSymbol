# BalanceSymbol

______________________
This Java code provides a method to check whether a given string containing various symbols (parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets) is balanced. It utilizes a stack data structure to determine the balance of the symbols.

# Code Explanation
The code consists of the following components:

1, BalancedSymbol Method: This method takes a string (S) as input and checks whether the symbols in the string are balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of opening symbols and compares them with closing symbols. If the symbols are balanced, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

2, main Method: This is the entry point of the program. It demonstrates the usage of the BalancedSymbol method by providing two example strings (CharToCheck and CharToCheck2) and printing the results of the balance check.

# Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

1, Copy the code into a Java file, e.g., BalancingSymbol.java.
2, Compile the Java file using a Java compiler:
***************************
javac BalancingSymbol.java
***************************
3, Run the compiled Java program:
***************************
java BalancingSymbol
***************************
4, The program will output the results of the balance check for the provided example strings.

# Example Output
The output of the provided main method for the example strings CharToCheck and CharToCheck2 will be:
************************
false
true
